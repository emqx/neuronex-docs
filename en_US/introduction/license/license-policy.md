## Apply for a license

Trial EMQ licenses can be downloaded from the [official EMQ website](https://www.emqx.com/en/contact?product=neuronex). All available plug-in modules and data stream processing functions are available for a 15-day trial period with a limit of 1000 data tags. If the trial EMQ license expires, you can reapply for a trial EMQ license through our website. However, a mailbox can only apply for two trial licenses at most.

:::tip
When you apply for a trial license on our website, you must use the hardware identification to bind the device. You can directly [contact us](https://www.emqx.com/en/contact?product=neuronex) to apply for a license without hardware identification for device binding, or apply for a full license.
